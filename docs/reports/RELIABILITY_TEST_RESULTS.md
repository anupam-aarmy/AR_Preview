   - Depth conditioning working but diffusion process removing products
   - Affects all room types consistently

2. **Room Morphing Issue:**
   - Original room characteristics being altered during generation
   - Room dimensions preserved but appearance significantly changed
   - Lighting and texture inconsistencies

3. **Integration Quality:**
   - Products not properly diffusing into wall surfaces
   - Lacks realistic blending expected from generative approach

- **Diffusion Process:** ~60s per size variant
- **Total Time:** ~75s per variant (acceptable for generative approach)
- **Issue:** Performance good but output quality compromised

## üéØ Quality Assessment

### Task 1: Excellent Quality ‚úÖ
- **Wall Segmentation:** Accurate SAM detection across all room types

## üîç Key Findings

### Task 1 Strengths ‚úÖ
1. **Performance Optimization:** Reduced processing time from ~50s to ~8s per product
2. **Reliability:** 100% success rate across all room types and scenarios
3. **Quality Enhancement:** Fixed alpha blending to preserve original product colors
4. **Copy-Paste Fix:** Eliminated artificial appearance, products now blend naturally
5. **Memory Management:** Automatic image resizing handles any resolution input

### Task 2 Infrastructure Strengths ‚úÖ
1. **Depth Generation:** Intel DPT-large producing accurate depth maps
